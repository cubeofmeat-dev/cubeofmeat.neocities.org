Duke Nukem 3D

I was originally putting this game off as another Doom clone of the late 90's, and in a way I was right. But what sets Duke apart from other clones of the time is the use of equipment that really opens up the gameplay to experimentation. The sandbox is typical, 0-9 has all the weapons you could ever need, and the different chapters in the game you search and find all your weapons again in classic fashion. The equipment however, includes the likes of distracting enemies with the Holo-Duke, Jetpacks that got you to crazy areas, Health packs (these I was quite fond of) that healed you mid battle (no more looking for health around the level), and Steroids that increased your movement speed. Duke also famously (or infamously) chatters throughout the game with cheesy 90's oneliners in classic action star fashion. Some were hilariously dated, and some like "blow it out your ass" played on repeat so much I could almost feel it coming. Overall, I think this is a game worth playing to understand how the FPS genre evolved over the years, taking a formula like Doom and making something completely unique from it. I enjoyed my time through and through and I would definately replay, or at least mod, in the future.
