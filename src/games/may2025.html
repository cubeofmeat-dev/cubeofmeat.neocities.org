                                <p>Beat this in a day if that says anything about the game. For starters, Im playing
                                    with a mod that removed some of the bad choices they made with the game. No 2 weapon
                                    limit, no sprint, and faster general movement speed to be more akin to the
                                    predecessors. From what I played, Forever is fine - in the most mediocre of ways. Do
                                    I think people were maybe a bit to harsh on the game in total, perhaps. But if I
                                    spent 60 bucks on this back in 2009 I would be pissed too. </p>
                                <p>The gunplay is fine, the
                                    voice acting is okay at best (the cheesy one liners are here to stay), the music is
                                    forgettable, and the overall plot is very simple. I would love to see the modding
                                    community take this game and use its gunplay to transform it into something else,
                                    but no one will do that when 3D exists. When you think of a truly mid game, this is
                                    a game that should come to mind. Was it as bad as some people made it out to be,
                                    no...is it anything special or deserving of the Duke Nukem name, no again. </p>
                                <p> What
                                    could have helped this game, aside from a shorter and more clear development, would
                                    be to lean into the camp that is Duke Nukem. The fans know what he is, lean into the
                                    "America fuck yeah" that his character embodies, and lean into a faster paced, item
                                    based gameplay of the past. I know its been over a decade since Dukes last game, and
                                    frankly I dont blame the IP owners after this release, but I think Duke as a
                                    character deserves some love, and a team of caring individuals could bring him to a
                                    new audience as a Doom 2016 like revival. Id have hopes out for that, but until
                                    then...I guess Ill keep playing 3D. </p>

                                <p>I was originally putting this game off as another Doom clone of the late 90's, and in
                                    a way I was right. But what sets Duke apart from other clones of the time is the use
                                    of equipment that really opens up the gameplay to experimentation.</p>
                                <p> The sandbox is
                                    typical, 0-9 has all the weapons you could ever need, and the different chapters in
                                    the game you search and find all your weapons again in classic fashion. The
                                    equipment however, includes the likes of distracting enemies with the Holo-Duke,
                                    Jetpacks that got you to crazy areas, Health packs (these I was quite fond of) that
                                    healed you mid battle (no more looking for health around the level), and Steroids
                                    that increased your movement speed.
                                    Duke also famously (or infamously) chatters
                                    throughout the game with cheesy 90's oneliners in classic action star fashion. Some
                                    were hilariously dated, and some like "blow it out your ass" played on repeat so
                                    much I could almost feel it coming. </p>
                                <p>Overall, I think this is a game worth playing to
                                    understand how the FPS genre evolved over the years, taking a formula like Doom and
                                    making something completely unique from it. I enjoyed my time through and through
                                    and I would definately replay, or at least mod, in the future. </p>
