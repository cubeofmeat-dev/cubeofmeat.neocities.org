                                <p>I've been obsessed with Nuclear Throne for the past few weeks again as another foray
                                    into this beautifuly simple yet deceptively deep rouguelike. Something that keeps me
                                    coming back is the sheer brutality of the gameplay. It is amongst one of the harder
                                    rouguelikes I've played, and the game doesn't give you unlocks to make the game any
                                    easier. The simplicity keeps me coming back for more because I can jump in, finish
                                    an entire run in about 10 minutes, and then get off. None of which actually happens.
                                </p>
                                <p>Despite its simplicity in world and gameplay, the pace is breakneck. You are placed
                                    into the world with a weapon and a character of your choice, who all have unique
                                    playstyles, and your one and only goal is to reach the Nuclear Throne. Sounds
                                    easy...It's not. At minimum you take 1 damage from being touched, which doesnt sound
                                    like a lot, but when the max health(as far as I've seen) is 12, thats 1/12th of your
                                    total pool. Enemies who shoot are another story. Dealing up to 8 damage per hit, you
                                    can die instantly, sending you all the way back to the beginning losing all your
                                    progress. With no real progression it's crazy why I keep going back for more. Am I
                                    masocistic? Or is the game truely so addictive?</p>
                                <p>A combination of the punish and the potential bliss of success, and the simplistic
                                    gameplay have me stuck in a loop (pun intended), that I can't seem to free myself
                                    from. This is certainly one of those top tier roguelikes that you just keep coming
                                    back for more. It's not for the synergies and weapons of other roguelikes, rather
                                    the actual gameplay itself.
