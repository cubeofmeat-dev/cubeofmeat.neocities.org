                                <p>I got this game after watching gameplay from an "E3" presentation a few years back.
                                    This has been on my wishlist for some time, and got it at a great discount. What
                                    made me want to play it, outside of the obvious of it being a FPS RoboCop game
                                    (awesome), was how the game presented itself as very different for an FPS. With
                                    modern FPS's having you jump, slide, fly at the speed of sound around the arenas,
                                    Rogue City aimed to to something different...Deliver an authentic RoboCop
                                    experience.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    RoboCop cannot jump, sprint, slide, or do anything close to acrobatic. The game
                                    plays as if you are driving a tank. You WALK, quite literally, through the levels
                                    destroying everything in your wake. It's awesome. A power fantasy in such a
                                    different way, not only does Robo seem unstopplable in the movies, he FEELs
                                    unstoppable in the game. Armed with his trusty Auto 9, the only gun you could ever
                                    need, RoboCop blasts his way through hordes of goons, robots, military, and the
                                    occasional ED 209. Everything just felt right, the gunplay mechanics were kept
                                    original with PCB boards that allowed you to change how the Auto 9 functioned, the
                                    perk system let you tailor your experience, the story and cheesy one liners felt
                                    right at home for a game made about an 80's movie, and the story had actual choices
                                    that impact the ending you recieve, an unexpected surprise, but a welcome one.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Speaking of surprises, the thing that surprised me the most about RoboCop was the
                                    amount of actual cop/detective moments you experienced in the game. When I bought
                                    Rogue City, I was under the impression I was going to get a short FPS romp where you
                                    mindlessly roll through hundreds of dudes to get to the main bad guy. Nothing wrong
                                    with that, and I would have been happy with that as a game in general, but the slow
                                    sections where you actually feel like a cop on beat really pulled you into the
                                    universe and made this game into something truely unique. From questioning citizens
                                    about recent crimes, to investigating murders, to handing out parking tickets (yes,
                                    that's actually real), RoboCop took what could have been a fun, yet somewhat
                                    repetative game, and turned it into something surprising in all the right ways.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I was happy all the way through my roughly 20 hour playthrough, including a decent
                                    amount but not all side content, and I am not finding any negatives really to talk
                                    about. Overall a fun experience despite being a little corny at times. I hope to
                                    play the standalone DLC one day when I get that RoboCop itch again!

                                    Awakening</p>
                                <p>A throwback with a new cute coat of paint. Link's Awakening truly does feel like a
                                    game from the early GameBoy days, however the quality of life changes they've made
                                    to the games have made it feel less frustrating (in parts), but still maintains that
                                    Zelda level of crypticness.
                                </p>
                                <p>I quite enjoyed exploring and discovering throughout the lands, which gave me the
                                    energy to continue the game at a hyperfixation pace. The classic, you need an item
                                    to get through to the dungeon, and you use the item to defeat the dungeon boss is
                                    very clear here in this game - and I was happy to see that design again. While the
                                    game isn't necessarily "hard", the real challenge comes from the dungeon puzzles,
                                    which have you backtracking and thinking "hmm - am I fucking something up right
                                    now?", in which many times was the case!</p>
                                <p>Notoriously, I got stuck multiple times either in a dungeon or following the game's
                                    trading quest, and had to just step back out of frustration. But, after a little
                                    more time in the oven of my brain, and a refreshed point of view, I was almost
                                    always able to beat what previously stood in my way. Albeit I did have to watch a
                                    walkthrough, specifically for the Grotto and Bird dungeon, because of 2 wildly
                                    different reasons.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The Grotto dungeon I got caught up with the word clue, "First defeat the imprisoned
                                    Pols Voice. Last, the Skeletal Stalfos...". First, what the fuck is a Pols Voice.
                                    Second, what the fuck is a Stalfos. Unlike the days of yore, games no longer come
                                    with manuals that give you a little more information about the world and enemies in
                                    it, and you have to look up what enemies were called to understand that puzzle to
                                    finally beat it. The bird dungeon is infamously difficult, and mostly just required
                                    a lot of lot of backtracking and some time away to finally beat it.
                                </p>
                                <p>Overall, Link's Awakening was a quite enjoyable experience despite showing a little
                                    age in its game design. As a package, its complete and there is something for
                                    everyone to enjoy. There's exploration, discovery, action, puzzles, music, art, and
                                    humor! I'm glad this game got this remaster treatment, cause I probably wouldn't
                                    have gone back to play the original without it. I'm happy with the time I spent with
                                    it, and wish I played it sooner.</p>
