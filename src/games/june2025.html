                                <p>While I've longed to replay Lies of P, the Overture DLC presented itself to me at the
                                    perfect time. From what I recalled Lies of P was a near perfect game, perhaps one of
                                    the best non FromSoftware souls-like we've ever seen, and on second play I still
                                    think that's true.
                                </p>
                                <p>A game like this only comes a long once every decade or so. How can the human mind
                                    create something so unique. Based on the story of Pinocchio (obviously), Studio8
                                    takes a rather well known story and creates their own world out of the source
                                    material. Puppets, life force (ergo), lying, being human...All these themes are here
                                    in the game, just represented in a way I never really thought possible. </p>
                                <p>At a glace, its a bloodborne-type Victoria era France setting with difficult bosses
                                    and a rewarding gameplay loop. The game takes the already proven formula, and adds
                                    new twists in the means of story beats, weapon mechanics, and hidden background
                                    story drivers that most other souls games lack. </p>
                                <p>Switch weapons around, changing handles and blades to suit your playstyle. For me, I
                                    like faster attacks this go round, but liked the CC of wide sweeping attacks. Put a
                                    dagger blade on a great sword hilt and BAM - a fast low distance sword that has
                                    great control for multiple enemies. This experimenting compliments the story, as you
                                    get to learn about yourself and make choices in the shoes of a puppet who is
                                    becoming more and more human. Experiment with lying. Lying to make yourself sound
                                    better. Lying to save others from the harsh truth. And finally, this compliments the
                                    background mechanics of the story. Lying has consequences, but ultimately makes you
                                    more human - which isn't that the entire goal of the game? I've not had a game make
                                    me want to replay as much as this one has, even if its just to get another ending.
                                </p>
                                <p>Overall, I'm ready to begin the Overture DLC. I'm ready to keep singing this games
                                    praises. Most importantly, I'm extremely satisfied with the game as a whole. Was is
                                    flawless, no, no game ever is. But despite is minimal flaws, so minimal I don't even
                                    bother to write them now, Lies of P is an experience worth having, regardless of if
                                    you like souls-like games. Lies of P is one of the games that I would love to
                                    experience for the first time again.</p>

                                <p>Turok for me was somewhat of an unexpected play. I found myself really bored on the
                                    steamdeck playing the same roguelikes I always play. Turok was just sitting there
                                    and I've had it in my library for a while now. I'm still in a boomer shooter mood
                                    having
                                    just got off the heels of Duke Nukem 3D, and this fit the bill for the moment.
                                    Previous console release, easy controller play for couch gaming, and something not
                                    too terribly long.
                                </p>
                                <p>I had read/watched some reviews of Turok prior saying it doesnt really age very well.
                                    While it does have some outdated mechanics not really welcome in shooters anymore
                                    (platforming, collectables, all those 90's tropes) I feel like it fits right in for
                                    the time period when the game came out...which was the 90's. </p>
                                <p>The platforming was a
                                    bit rough at times, and there was a moment on the last level where I was up shits
                                    creek without a paddle down to my last life, scourging the levels again for Turok
                                    Coins (idk what those are actually called), just to get another life for the end
                                    game level. On the positive side of that, you do get the sweet "I AM TUROK" when you
                                    get 100 coins so that was nice. </p>
                                <p>That was pretty much my only negative interaction with the game. The movement was
                                    smooth, the guns were fun, the levels were cool and sprawling, and it was just a
                                    generally good time, despite its quirks. I remember playing this at a friends house
                                    way back in the day and thinking "man, I wish my parents would let me play M rated
                                    games", and now that I'm an adult and I can do what I want, finally able to play
                                    this 90's classic.</p>
                                <p>I'm most likely going to continue the series as a shooter I can play on the steam
                                    deck, and I'm happy that I spent my time on it.</p>
