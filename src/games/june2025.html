                                <p>Turok for me was somewhat of an unexpected play. I found myself really bored on the
                                    steamdeck playing the same roguelikes I always play. Turok was just sitting there
                                    and I've had it in my library for a while now. I'm still in a boomer shooter mood
                                    having
                                    just got off the heels of Duke Nukem 3D, and this fit the bill for the moment.
                                    Previous console release, easy controller play for couch gaming, and something not
                                    too terribly long.
                                </p>
                                <p>I had read/watched some reviews of Turok prior saying it doesnt really age very well.
                                    While it does have some outdated mechanics not really welcome in shooters anymore
                                    (platforming, collectables, all those 90's tropes) I feel like it fits right in for
                                    the time period when the game came out...which was the 90's. </p>
                                <p>The platforming was a
                                    bit rough at times, and there was a moment on the last level where I was up shits
                                    creek without a paddle down to my last life, scourging the levels again for Turok
                                    Coins (idk what those are actually called), just to get another life for the end
                                    game level. On the positive side of that, you do get the sweet "I AM TUROK" when you
                                    get 100 coins so that was nice. </p>
                                <p>That was pretty much my only negative interaction with the game. The movement was
                                    smooth, the guns were fun, the levels were cool and sprawling, and it was just a
                                    generally good time, despite its quirks. I remember playing this at a friends house
                                    way back in the day and thinking "man, I wish my parents would let me play M rated
                                    games", and now that I'm an adult and I can do what I want, finally able to play
                                    this 90's classic.</p>
                                <p>I'm most likely going to continue the series as a shooter I can play on the steam
                                    deck, and I'm happy that I spent my time on it.</p>
