                                    For everyone who hasn't played this game yet, please do so now. I don't know why it
                                    took me so long for me to actually play this. I have tried on 2 seperate attempts,
                                    and both times I have only played for the first session, or loop if you will, then
                                    put it down for seemingly months or even years. The problem with that is I was
                                    missing out on possibly some of the greatest sense of discovery and reward in
                                    gaming.
                                </p>

                                    It's hard to describe the feeling you get when discovering in Outer Wilds. Slowly
                                    unraveling a story when you start bright eyed and bushy tailed, knowing nothing
                                    about the world and universe you are in. Piecing together through cryptic messages,
                                    field notes, black boxes, and ultimately on your first run seeing the sun go
                                    supernova and having to restart at square one. Perhaps that what made me quit
                                    originally. Having to restart every run at the very beginning, with no combat or
                                    other mechanics to master felt bad to my brain, but that is the beauty of Outer
                                    Wilds. You dont lose everything on death, what you gain is knowledge. Knowledge to
                                    carry you to continue discovering! There are sequences in the game that are
                                    impossible to figure out without knowing more first, and the game implements the
                                    classic metroidvania trope of - "If youre stuck here, come back later" - and in
                                    doing so, you uncover so much more and are able to keep progressing. At times, you
                                    feel so insignifigant against the philosophical questions the game prompts. "Why are
                                    we here?", "What if all of this is pointless if we know the end?", "Why bother
                                    learning more?". And that's part of what makes the game great.

                                    The drive to discover more held me captive for the play time of this game, literally
                                    leaving me incapable of thinking of anything else because I was so engrossed in
                                    finding the next piece. You start so small, "visit the moon", where your journey
                                    begins and where you first learn of what is out there. Just barely getting your toes
                                    wet you venture to other planets, find that they are all hostile in their own unique
                                    way, die or wait for the supernova to come and start it all again. The game leads
                                    you with a web of discovery, telling you locations you visit and whether or not
                                    there is more to discover at each location. It is a really clever way of using the
                                    classic crazy guy red lines to unravel a mystery, and to figure out that all those
                                    red lines point back to one large item right in the center was some of the best
                                    discovery I've had in gaming. Okay major spoilers ahead because I have to talk about
                                    it, then I'll wrap up. <span class="spoiler">When I learned about the Nomai, knowing
                                        that this precursor race is dead and has been gone for a long long time, I was
                                        so interested to find out why it happened. Naturally over many loops I was lead
                                        to the comet, just to discover what they were looking for on there. Lo and
                                        behold, my greatest AHA moment, and a moment in my gaming history I don't think
                                        I would every forget. The commet that slowly orbits the sun contained a unstable
                                        compound what we knew in the game as ghost matter, when the commet approached
                                        the sun, BAM! Ghost matter spreads across the solar system killing all Nomai in
                                        its tracks. Your species in game was too early, living in water pools on the
                                        planet, and was unimpacted. Thousands of years later, here you are discovering
                                        what came before you. Again, once you reach the commet you slowly realize, wait
                                        a minute this commet must be orbiting for a while, why does it always dissapear
                                        from the game at the end of the loop? Wow, the same commet that ended the Nomai,
                                        is ending you! The Ash Twin projected needed a super nova, and the commet once
                                        again is supplying the end of the solar system! Except this time, YOU activated
                                        the project, thus saving yourself every 22 minutes! Wow!</span>

                                    Outer Wilds is an amazing experience, and one I hold in very high regard despite not
                                    playing it through originally. I think this is a game that does storytelling in a
                                    very unique and interesting way, and it's something I think every gamer should
                                    experience themselves. Despite some frustration with a lack of direction at times (I
                                    was stumped for a while on what to do, and ended up going to get some hints from the
                                    subreddit - those people do a great job at giving hints without spoilers), Outer
                                    Wilds is a game that I'm so happy to have played, and is an experience I will not
                                    ever forget.
