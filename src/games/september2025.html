                                    A random play for sure. Don't really know what compelled me to play outside of 'it
                                    was in my library so fuck it, why not?'. I'm happy that I did. Rage is one of those
                                    games that's not amazing or revolutionary, it just kinda is its own thing. I
                                    appreciate that about it the most. It's unique in its own way and it's not trying to
                                    be anything else but Rage (story wise). The game itself is an amalgamation of a few
                                    different game ideas, and was a way for id to experiment with different design
                                    philosophies than were accustomed to seeing from that team. Does it hit every nail
                                    on the head, well no, but what it does hit sets it up well for the sequel, which I'm
                                    hoping the things that weren't quite so fleshed out in Rage, could be made better in
                                    the second.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Rage as a game is id's way to break into the Mad Max/Borderlands/Fallout crazy of
                                    the early 2010's. Car combat, dusty towns, and jank weapons were highlights of those
                                    games/media, and is something I think Rage does really well. What I thought stood
                                    out the most about Rage is the focus on making the towns certainly feel alive. The
                                    way you get quests feels natural, like someone getting your attention like they do
                                    in Fallout. Moving from town to town had you in your trusty Car, battling other
                                    bandits while moving around the map. While that was fun at first, I really wish this
                                    game put more emphasis on the car combat. The Mad Max game (albeit came out 5 years
                                    later) had a huge emphasis on this, and it really paid off. That's part of what I am
                                    getting at with Rage. It is trying a lot of new things, but it doesn't particularly
                                    standout.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    With the car combat a little lack luster, and really only getting to interact with
                                    it during races, its hard to really critique it. I just wanted more of it. The game
                                    makes you drive 2 seconds with hardly any combat, get out and start shooting. It's
                                    id tech now, so of course shooting is a big part of the game, but it feels like the
                                    gameplay loop is more segmented than it needed to be. On the topic of shooting,
                                    there is nothing really special here outside the use of the multiple ammo types,
                                    which is a neat idea, however certain ammo types are just a straight upgrade, making
                                    the original ammo obsolete. Again another thing that could improve with the sequel.
                                    A decent amount of the encounters were well designed, but most followed kind of a
                                    strict formula - shoot your way in, do a thing, shoot your way out. Not bad, but by
                                    the end it really was just formulaic and I would've appreciated some variety.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    All in all, Rage is by no means a bad game, it's also not a good game either. Im
                                    satisfied with my time in it, and was addicted to completing it. I think the
                                    gameplay of the car combat and shooting was quite good, just not special on its own.
                                    I would love for the sequel to be less segmented between those parts. What I do hope
                                    stays, are the amazing animations (I didn't talk enough about this), and the town
                                    design (maybe Ill expand on this in another paragraph). I'd like to continue on
                                    because the game ends on a MASSIVE cliff hanger, but does setup a sequel pretty
                                    perfectly. Hopefully the minor gripes I had with the game end up getting better in
                                    the sequel. Happy with what I played, but it's not one I would revisit any time
                                    soon.

                                    For everyone who hasn't played this game yet, please do so now. I don't know why it
                                    took me so long for me to actually play this. I have tried on 2 seperate attempts,
                                    and both times I have only played for the first session, or loop if you will, then
                                    put it down for seemingly months or even years. The problem with that is I was
                                    missing out on possibly some of the greatest sense of discovery and reward in
                                    gaming.
                                </p>

                                    It's hard to describe the feeling you get when discovering in Outer Wilds. Slowly
                                    unraveling a story when you start bright eyed and bushy tailed, knowing nothing
                                    about the world and universe you are in. Piecing together through cryptic messages,
                                    field notes, black boxes, and ultimately on your first run seeing the sun go
                                    supernova and having to restart at square one. Perhaps that what made me quit
                                    originally. Having to restart every run at the very beginning, with no combat or
                                    other mechanics to master felt bad to my brain, but that is the beauty of Outer
                                    Wilds. You dont lose everything on death, what you gain is knowledge. Knowledge to
                                    carry you to continue discovering! There are sequences in the game that are
                                    impossible to figure out without knowing more first, and the game implements the
                                    classic metroidvania trope of - "If youre stuck here, come back later" - and in
                                    doing so, you uncover so much more and are able to keep progressing. At times, you
                                    feel so insignifigant against the philosophical questions the game prompts. "Why are
                                    we here?", "What if all of this is pointless if we know the end?", "Why bother
                                    learning more?". And that's part of what makes the game great.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The drive to discover more held me captive for the play time of this game, literally
                                    leaving me incapable of thinking of anything else because I was so engrossed in
                                    finding the next piece. You start so small, "visit the moon", where your journey
                                    begins and where you first learn of what is out there. Just barely getting your toes
                                    wet you venture to other planets, find that they are all hostile in their own unique
                                    way, die or wait for the supernova to come and start it all again. The game leads
                                    you with a web of discovery, telling you locations you visit and whether or not
                                    there is more to discover at each location. It is a really clever way of using the
                                    classic crazy guy red lines to unravel a mystery, and to figure out that all those
                                    red lines point back to one large item right in the center was some of the best
                                    discovery I've had in gaming. Okay major spoilers ahead because I have to talk about
                                    it, then I'll wrap up. <span class="spoiler">When I learned about the Nomai, knowing
                                        that this precursor race is dead and has been gone for a long long time, I was
                                        so interested to find out why it happened. Naturally over many loops I was lead
                                        to the comet, just to discover what they were looking for on there. Lo and
                                        behold, my greatest AHA moment, and a moment in my gaming history I don't think
                                        I would every forget. The commet that slowly orbits the sun contained a unstable
                                        compound what we knew in the game as ghost matter, when the commet approached
                                        the sun, BAM! Ghost matter spreads across the solar system killing all Nomai in
                                        its tracks. Your species in game was too early, living in water pools on the
                                        planet, and was unimpacted. Thousands of years later, here you are discovering
                                        what came before you. Again, once you reach the commet you slowly realize, wait
                                        a minute this commet must be orbiting for a while, why does it always dissapear
                                        from the game at the end of the loop? Wow, the same commet that ended the Nomai,
                                        is ending you! The Ash Twin projected needed a super nova, and the commet once
                                        again is supplying the end of the solar system! Except this time, YOU activated
                                        the project, thus saving yourself every 22 minutes! Wow!</span>

                                    Outer Wilds is an amazing experience, and one I hold in very high regard despite not
                                    playing it through originally. I think this is a game that does storytelling in a
                                    very unique and interesting way, and it's something I think every gamer should
                                    experience themselves. Despite some frustration with a lack of direction at times (I
                                    was stumped for a while on what to do, and ended up going to get some hints from the
                                    subreddit - those people do a great job at giving hints without spoilers), Outer
                                    Wilds is a game that I'm so happy to have played, and is an experience I will not
                                    ever forget.

                                    My brother and I played through Quake 2 and most of Quake 2 64 as a random game to
                                    play while in between some more multiplayer games coming in October. I remember when
                                    I originally played through Quake 2 and some expansions around a year or two ago I
                                    thought it was a solid B tier game, and while not as good as its predecessor, still
                                    scratched that boomer shooter itch in a way only Quake can. I still love the
                                    movement, and the weapons still feel very good even nearly 30 years later, which
                                    really is a testament to Id's talent back in the day.

                                <p>
                                    While I dont really like the shift from random dude kinda killing weird aliens in a
                                    hodge podge set of worlds to a clearly defined enemy with clearly defined level
                                    design and art style, I understand it completely. Id wanted to have a world they
                                    could build on for the Quake universe where the first game did not have that. For me
                                    though, the variety and fun to be had with the first Quake still trumps the more
                                    clear direction of the sequals 2 and 4, and something in me just wishes we could
                                    just have more of that random level mindset from Quake 1 (yes I know there are lots
                                    of mods out there, I did that the same when I played Duke Nukem 3D lol). Beside
                                    that, I do have one more gripe about Quake 2, but actually fixes itself in the 64
                                    version - allow me to explain.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Quake 2 goes for a much more bombastic approach to the formula, taking a little bit
                                    of the success of Doom and adding a totally rockin' out soundtrack dude to this
                                    newwer version of Quake. For me, that completely falls flat. I feel like quake is
                                    the darker more sinister version of Doom, and the vibe that Quake 1 establishes is
                                    completely thrown out the window in 2. It's just weird to have this chugging metal
                                    sountrack playing over and over again when I'm having to backtrack to find where
                                    that CD needs to go and I personally think it makes me review Quake 2 lower.
                                    However, the 64 version had way less music, and instead some droning ambience in the
                                    levels, which I thought made the Strogg much more sinister in tone, which I
                                    appreciated much more. There also was a nice bop at the end of each level signifying
                                    you completed your main objective, if only the main version of Quake 2 went with
                                    this approach like 64 did.

                                    All that said, Quake 2 is not a bad game by any extent and what for me was a solid B
                                    tier on original play through, was raised to a slightly higher tier just for the
                                    existance of the DLC and 64, which proves that the ideas of Quake 2 are strong, but
                                    perhaps the execution of the original campaign was just not as. It was a fun run
                                    through regardless, and some much needing gaming time for me and brother to spend
                                    together.
